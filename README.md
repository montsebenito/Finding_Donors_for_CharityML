# Finding_Donors_for_CharityML. Project Overview:
This is my first project for [Introduction to ML with TensorFlow Nanodegree Program at Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning-with-tensorflow-nanodegree--nd230)

Optimized several different supervised learners to predict highest donation yield (3.7x fscore (0.75 vs 0.2 naive predictor) +15% accuracy (0.869 vs 0.752 naive predictor). 
- **Business Understanding**
- **Data Understanding**: Explored data collected from the 1994 US Census with 45222 observations and 13 variables + target
- **Data Preparation**: Normalized numerical features, transformed skewed continuous features plus one-hot encoded categorical variables.
- **Data Modeling**: Compared and Optimized different ensemble methods using GridCV.
- **Results Evaluation**: Discussed effects of feature selection.


## Code and Resources Used
- Python Version: 3.8.5
